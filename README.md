# In-app browser bypass demo

If you open a link in TikTok's or Instagram's apps, they don't open using the
native browser, but using the respective social network's built-in browser.
This causes serious privacy concerns for once, but according to
stackoverflow, also interferes with basic functions such as printing the
website.

[See demo here.](https://yassin-younis.github.io/bypass-in-app-browser/)

To try out the demo, you can:

1. Open the tiktok (or instagram) app.
2. Browse to a popular creator's profile that contains a youtube link
3. Tap the youtube link (will open in-app browser)
4. Enter `google.com` into the youtube searchbar
5. There will be at least one video that has a link to Google in its video descripton, tap it.
6. Search for this repository (or my username).
7. Browse to the above link.
8. Should redirect to your native browser
